# Multiphasic Orbit
Multiphasic Orbit is an experimental space-based, turn-based strategy game inspired by The Orville (TV Series). In Multiphasic orbit, players can build and customize their own solar systems, collect resources, facilitate trade between planets, and defend their creation from Rogue planets. The player must pass all three tests, or be rejected.

Players assume the role of a demigod, who is attempting to earn their full license, which is like a Driver's License test for becoming a God. Only after mastering a series of test simulations in 3D and 4D space, will they be certified to create their own solar systems.

## Postmortem
Our design philosophies that led to the ideation of Multiphasic Orbit remained consistent throughout its development process. The density of features we wanted was ambitious for a 4 month project, and functionality we promised was not always not ready for our playtesting sessions. To make matters worse, we learned that using Unity Collaborate Cloud to automatically merge our code was “up to the gods”. In the final month, we succeeded in implementing phasing between multiple universes.

Throughout the life of the project, structured levels (such as the Learner’s test) would break as new features were added. We resolved this, by building an isolated “sandbox” environment, to test new code, user interfaces, and mission architectures before merging them into our main scenes.

By the last week, our team was exhausted, but due to excellent communication, prototyping, and feedback, we were able to deliver both the game we had envisioned, and a game were all proud of.
